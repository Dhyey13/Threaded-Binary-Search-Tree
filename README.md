 Threaded binary search tree lab. Contains methods
 to input default file ("hamlet.txt") or sequences of files in commandline
 arguments. The functions will add a token of each word in the text file into
 the tbst, and tbst will print the sorted content of the tokens either 
 most to least or least to most frequency. The printout can be in console or
 output file ("lab5output.txt").
